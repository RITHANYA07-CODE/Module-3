# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `52` and the element `12` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `52` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `12` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
x =("12", 8, "21", "10", "11", "52", "u", "r", "c", "e")
print("52" in x)
print("12" in x)
```

## Output

## Result
The program successfully checks the existence of elements in the tuple.
